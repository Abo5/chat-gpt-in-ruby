# To create an AI chatbot similar to GPT-3 in Ruby, you can use the GPT-3 API provided by OpenAI. Here is a simple example code using the OpenAI GPT-3 API in Ruby:

require 'openai'

# Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your OpenAI API key
OpenAI.configure do |c|
  c.api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
end

response = OpenAI.Completion.create(
  engine: 'davinci',
  prompt: 'Once upon a time',
  max_tokens: 100
)

puts response.choices[0].text


# This code uses the OpenAI gem to interact with the GPT-3 API. You need to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key. The code sends a prompt to the GPT-3 engine 'davinci' and receives a completion back with a generated text.

# You can further customize the interactions with the GPT-3 API by adjusting the parameters sent in the `OpenAI.Completion.create` method, such as changing the engine, prompt, and max_tokens values.

# Keep in mind that using the GPT-3 API may incur costs, so make sure to review the pricing and terms of use provided by OpenAI.
